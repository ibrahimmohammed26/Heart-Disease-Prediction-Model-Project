# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model-Project

This was a basic machine learning project, and my first one, where I learnt some basic concepts. I hope to learn more, and I enjoyed developing this project.

To run this application:
- You would need to go into terminal, and type in this command: C:\Users\ibrah\Downloads\Heart-Disease-Prodiction-Model-main\app.py
- This will open in a new page, and then to check for each row of data, copy and paste, but get rid of the last digit, and its previous comma
- Now this might vary for different interfaces
